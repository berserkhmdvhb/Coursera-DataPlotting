  <caption>Figure 5</caption>
  <note>Use color effectively.This figure represents the same signal, whose frequency increases to the right and intensity increases towards the bottom, using three different colormaps. The rainbow colormap (qualitative) and the seismic colormap (diverging) are equally bad for such a signal because they tend to hide details in the high frequency domain (bottom-right part). Using a sequential colormap such as the purple one, it is easier to see details in the high frequency domain. Adapted from [5].</note>
